               Radio Ad Spot: For this project, I was asked to record myself reading a script and
               then add the appropriate designs to the audio to convey the tone and message of the
               script. I added and edited sounds such as music samples and special FX.<br><br>
               <a href="Media/NoahMarchbanks2.wav">Radio Spot</a>
               <p>
                Upon completion of this project, I understood the concepts that are used in audio
                design and a lot more goes on behind the scenes than one might think. I learned that
                sounds must be given the correct pitch and effect to match the tone of the purpose. For
                example, if the purpose is to portray the importance of giving back to others, you might
                add some slow, somber music to create an empathetic tone.

        <p>
            Logo Design: For this project, I was asked to create and design logos for a
        fictional company by the name of “RetroWeird Software”. I was given the branding of the
        company and had to create logos that portrayed the brand in a professional way that is
        unique and pertains to the theme using color theory.<br><br>

        <p>
        Upon completion of this project, I was capable of applying branding and styling techniques
        that compliment the focus of the brand and the purpose of the company.

        <div id="Thumbnail">
        Thumbnail Design: For this project, I was asked to create a thumnail for a documentary about
        the Joplin tornado story. I was given images to choose from and edit together to create a scene
        that follows the theme and matches the tone of the documentary.<br><br>

        <p>
            Upon completion of this project, I was able to understand how to create a scene that accurately
            depicts the tone of a given video and the importance of minute details.
