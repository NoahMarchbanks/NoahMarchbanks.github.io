        As a second semester college student, I have already learned so much more
        than what I could’ve imagined. I started my college experience as a Computer Science
        major and after my first semester, decided that the IT program
        fit me more comfortably. Although computer science is a great program and had tons to
        offer me, as things started to drift further away from what I originally wanted, I had to
        take a step back and ask myself what my goals were. I decided to go with IT because it
        is more my pace and focuses on the things that I value the most in my academic career.</p>
        <p>
        During college, I have been able to learn a lot about myself. I have realized what
        I like to learn about and the things that I am best at. I have also learned to work not only
        on the things I am already good at, but especially the things that I’m not the strongest in.
        This allows me to address my weaknesses and eventually turn them into strengths.</p>
        <p>
        The <em>beautiful</em> program of <strong>Information Technology</strong> has given me the opportunity to
        learn the things I am most interested in and allows me to hone my skills in every aspect
        imaginable. I am able to focus not only on software development, but things such as
        audio and graphic design. These different departments can be combined into every
        project that I work on in my future career to produce better and more efficient results.</p>
        <p>
        I have learned so much about coding in only two semesters and plan to continue
        my journey, learning just about anything I can get my hands on. I love to learn and use
        my abilities to create things for the world and aspire to be able to continue doing so
        throughout my life after college as a software developer.
