     My name is Noah Marchbanks. I am a freshman majoring in Information Technology at the University of Missouri. 
     All my life, I have been fascinated by technology and the underlying components within. When I was younger,
     I would try to create my own games and programs on simplified coding websites. I would spend my free time 
     working on personal projects of something I envisioned. I became a perfectionist and tried to perfect my 
     programs, making improvements wherever I could. I quickly fell in love with coding and the process of 
     creation. Now that I am in college, I have begun my journey to gain the knowledge and experience in 
     coding necessary to become successful in the future. When I graduate, I plan to make my dreams a 
     reality by either becoming a software or video game developer to bring my visions to life for the world to
     see.
