        <h4>Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Noah Marchbanks

        This website will contain information about myself such as my experiences, projects,
    education and more. The purpose of this website is to display my capabilities and what I
    have to offer potential employers. Firstly, I will explain a little about myself and my
    academic career thus far. Then, I will demonstrate my competencies and provide
    projects that display my proficiency in their respective department. Each department will
    briefly explain the purpose of the project and what I learned during the production
    thereof. Lastly, I will reflect on what I have learned throughout my college career and the
    decisions that I had to make to follow the path that fitted me the best.
