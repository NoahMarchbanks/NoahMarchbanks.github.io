            <p>
                    My name is Noah Marchbanks and I am currently a freshman majoring in <em>Information
                Technology</em> at the <em>University of Missouri</em>. I am from a small town at the very bottom 
                of Missouri and formed an interest in technology when I was young. I love to code and have been 
                doing it in some form for the majority of my life. </p>
                <p>I am very creative and love to challenge myself by jumping into different coding 
                languages. I also like to venture into graphic and audio design and practice designing different things that
                will help me bring my programs to life.<br> I love superheros and love to learn about them. I am a huge
                fan of both Marvel and DC. They have always fascinated me and I love to imagine the different fights that could
                ensue between any two different heroes (or villains).
                <br>I also love video games and usually play a variety during my free time. As I have started to 
                learn and practice coding and designing, I have developed a different way of looking at video games.
                I have grown an incredible appreciation for the process that came before the final product.
                That meaning, whenever I'm playing the game, I try to envision the code and designing techniques 
                that were used to create what I am seeing before me. I hope to do the same one day and to be able 
                to create something that people <strong>all over the world</strong> can enjoy.
